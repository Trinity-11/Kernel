# License
The C256 system software will be released under an open source license. This license *will allow* commercial sale of hardware which includes this software. However, this software will always remain free. (ie: we will never TiVo this code. You will always be able to download it and install it on a 65816 computer.) 

By contributing to this project, you grant Stefany Allaire and the C256 Foenix team a non-exclusive, unlimited license to use any contributed materials. This means you retain ownership of your work, so you can use it elsewhere, but you grant the C256 team the right to do use it in the C256. This may include commercial sale of the C256 hardware. 

The C256 software will always remain open source and free for all to use, even with other hardware or software simulators. 

NuPET ASCII font, character set, and its related information (ROMs, demonstration images, character ROM files, etc) are donated to the public domain.
